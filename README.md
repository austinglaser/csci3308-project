Project for CSCI 3308
=====================

# Ideas

## Austin's

- **Embedded test frontend**
    - Would talk to some (extremely) light-weight firmmare on an embedded
        device
    - Possibly measure signals on the device (much harder)
    - Would run, validate, and log tests for the device
- **Lighting controller or other embedded sensor/controller**
    - Controlled via TCP or similar
    - Could be controlled over:
        - WiFi
        - ZigBee
        - Ethernet
        - Bluetooth (Austin has some hardware that could be used)
    - Would involve embedded (C) and application-level development
        - Austin has experience with the embedded side
- **(More to follow, maybe)**

## Alan's, building on Austin's

- **Home automation and usage statistics**
    - network interface w/ web/mobile app
    - time spent using lights, TV, etc.
    - fancy graphs

- **Cool light displays**
    - Christmas lights
    - music visualization
    - whatever
     
## Jon's idea

- **Web/mobile app that takes product and searches Amazon, Newegg, tigerdirect etc. for lowest price**
    - Could keep track of prices over time (lows, highs)
    - Could keep list of desired items
    - Could notify user (via email?) when best deal found
