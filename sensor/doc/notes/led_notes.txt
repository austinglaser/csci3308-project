# Timer Channel Allocation
 - LED chain on TIM2_CH1 (PA0 AF1)

# DMA Channels
 - TIM2_UP:  DMA1_CH2
 - TIM2_CH1: DMA1_CH5
 - TIM2_CH2: DMA1_CH7
 - TIM2_CH3: DMA1_CH1
 - TIM2_CH4: DMA1_CH7

# Configuration
 - PA0 configured as AF1, TIM2_CH1 CC output
 - Timer in PWM mode
 - TIM2_CCA1: 1 period, 0 period, reset (0)
 - Set OC1PE (preload enable)
 - DMA next bit on update event (starting with bit 1 on UEV 0)
 - To start:
    -- Preload CCA1 with bit 0
    -- Start timer
 - How to stop?
    -- Look at slave mode
    -- Maybe don't need to stop (write frames as fast as possible)
